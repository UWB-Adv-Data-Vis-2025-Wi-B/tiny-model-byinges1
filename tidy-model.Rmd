## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

`Introduction`

`This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.`

````
```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```
````
`##What is that sound?`
`In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.`

````
``` {r summary, echo = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
library(ggplot2)
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```
````
`## Temperature affects chirp rate`
````
```{r temp, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')
```
````
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
